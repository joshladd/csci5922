## CSCI 5922 Course Project

This is currently my spaghetti code as it is spread across multiple different platforms. The tensorflow code isn't even here yet! [It's here.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PbZjAoZU-macS30ytex-iMJ9kYBHlM6r) I will consolidate my (also spaghetti) code from Google Colab and my local machine by end of week, so I hope that is acceptable. 

Otherwise I will definitely be taking a big hit on my grade for the codebase, which I have come to terms with. In all likelihood, I will have cleaned and consolidated this codebase and removed the damaging parts of this readme before grading reaches me. Thank god for middle-of-the-alphabet names!
