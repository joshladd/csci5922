## CSCI 5922 Course Project

The nhlData.py file contains all of the small scripts I used to generate my data, but is not set up to arbitrarily run through all of them. It contains all the functions I used to create sequences of various feature sets for my data.

The iPython notebook contains the tensorflow code I used. It will only run if a slice of data is generated already for it. This means that you can't run my project end-to-end as it is set up, and I know I'll lose points for that.

I've also put my data figures in the repo.
